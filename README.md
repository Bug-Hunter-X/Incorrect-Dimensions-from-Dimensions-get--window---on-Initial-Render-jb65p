# React Native Dimensions API Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to obtain screen dimensions.  The problem arises because the dimensions might not be readily available upon component mounting, potentially causing inaccurate calculations or rendering problems.

## Bug Description

The `Dimensions.get('window')` method may return inaccurate dimensions if called before the layout has been fully determined. This typically leads to unexpected behavior during the initial render of a component that relies on screen dimensions for layout calculations or positioning of elements.

## Solution

The provided solution utilizes the `useEffect` hook to ensure the `Dimensions` API is accessed after the component has mounted and the layout is ready. This approach guarantees the dimensions are fetched correctly and that the component renders with accurate dimensions.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to run the application.
5. Observe that the initial render may have an incorrect screen height; however, after a brief delay (when layout is complete), the correct screen height will be displayed.
